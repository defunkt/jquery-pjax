  pjax loads html from your server into the current page
  without a full page load. It's ajax with real permalinks,
  page titles, and a working back button that fully degrades.
</p>

<p>
  Check the box to toggle pjax. Compare the experience of clicking around the three links listed above when pjax is enabled, versus when it's not.
</p>

<p>
  Whenever the time changes, a full page load has happened.
  If the time doesn't change,  no full page load has occurred.
</p>

<p>
  The idea is you can't tell the difference between pjax
  page loads and normal page loads. On complicated sites,
  browsing just "feels faster."
